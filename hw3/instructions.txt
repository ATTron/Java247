Programming Assignment 3
Reversing the Lines in a File
Due on Blackboard at 23:59 Monday 4 April 2016


Write a Java program that uses the Stack and Queue classes, and the
IStack and IQueue interfaces, discussed in class to store the lines of a
file in a queue and then to write the lines of the file in reverse order
to another file, using a stack.

See the example code for FileReverser.java. Note that the constructor
uses a FileInputStream to initialize a Scanner to read from a specified
input file. 

The constructor also initializes a PrintStream object (the same type of
object you are used to using as System.out) to write to the reversed
file.

Your task is to:

(1) Add code to initialize the Queue and Stack to the constructor.

(2) Write a void method readFile() that takes no parameters and reads
the file, line-by-line. Each line will be placed in the
queue. readFile() must close the Scanner when it is done reading.

(3) Write a void method called writeFile() that transfers the lines from
the queue to the stack, and then writes the contents of the stack to the
output file. writeFile() must close the PrintStream when it is done
writing.

(4) Provide a main() that does the following:
(4a) Prompt the user for the file name and read the file name.
(4b) Create a FileReverser object.
(4c) Call readFile() and writeFile() to create the reversed copy of the
file.

Note that this assignment can be done more efficiently without a
queue. Use the queue anyway.

Be sure to use @Override wherever appropriate.
