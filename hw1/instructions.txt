Provide a set of Java classes that implement ICoin.java. Each class must
include a value() method that returns the number of cents a coin of that
class is worth and a toString() method that overrides toString() in the
Object class and returns the name of the coin. For example, in the
Quarter class, value() would return 25 and toString() returns quarter.

Provide classes called Penny, Nickel, Dime, and Quarter.

Be sure to use @Override wherever appropriate.

Test your code using the Driver class provided by the instructor.
